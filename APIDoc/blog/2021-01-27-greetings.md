## Back End and Infastructure

### Who are we?
We are a student group in the Reykjavík Academy of Web Development and we are doing a group project in school. 
In this group project we are supposed to make a back-end application in the form of an API. The theme idea was to create a back-end application to learn about the basics and essentials of back-end development. 

Here is the projects description:

#### Project description.
In this project the group must create a back-end application in the format of an API, a software which will provide a service to any front-end application on the internet. Here are some characteristics of the final product:
- The technology stack can be comprised of any programming language, framework, libraries, database system and hosting platform the group wishes to use;
- There must be at least 5 endpoints (AKA routes, AKA app.get/app.post etc…) (each method counts as a separate implementation) which perform separate tasks;
- There must be a persistence layer (AKA a database) and the data provided via the API should come from this persistence layer;
- The application should perform all the CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update and Delete) and make sure there is Error Handling when a request generates an unexpected result, along with the correct Response Status Code (200, 404, etc);
- The application must either have an API key system or authentication system to prevent abuse;
- The application must use defense mechanisms to avoid common attacks (use of libraries allowed);
- The API should be well documented.
### What are we doing?
We decided to go with a showroom for the students of Vefþróun, where they could post articles to showcase some of their favorite work.
